# Assignment-2

## Planning for drunks

This assignment is going to build a model that shows where drunks walk in town when they're trying to get home.

* The folder contains:

1. A report (PDF file) with an explanation of the code development as well as UML diagrams and the code itself in the appendices.

2. A folder with the model. It contains the agent framework (agentframework_2.py), the model (drunk_model) and
a raster file (drunk.txt).
